The introduction to a course usually introduces the major themes and goals of the course.
This template aims to simplify the writing of a syllabus by providing a fast-rendering and clean style.
It uses the normal fonts, sizes, and colors that the template author uses for writing.

This means that you should install the [Spectral](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral) font.
If it is installed, it will be used by default.
Otherwise, you can set `mainfont: someotherfont` in the YAML header to use a different font.

Currently, for author information on the first page, only the name and email are used.
If this is insufficient, please open an issue at <https://github.com/christopherkenny/ctk-syllabus>.

# Course meetings

Typically, information should be included on the course meetings.

## Lectures

Especially with regard to lecture expectations.

## Sections

And section meetings, if applicable.

# Assignments

Grading schemes can be specified in a table format.
Tables in this template work off of [Quarto's markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html).

| Assignment | Points | Percentage |
|:-----------|-------:|-----------:|
| Lecture attendance | 25 | 12.5%  |
| Section attendance | 25 | 12.5%  |
| Problem Sets       | 70 | 35%    |
| Prelim #1          | 20 | 10%    |
| Prelim #2          | 20 | 10%    |
| Final proposal     | 10 | 5%     |
| Final              | 30 | 15%    |

: You can add a caption like this, but it's probably not necessary. {#tbl-grading}

But, giving it a name like above is helpful so you can reference @tbl-grading in the text.

# Course policies

Then, it's probably helpful to add some policies.

## Use of Large Language Models

> Using ChatGPT to complete assignments short-circuits the learning process, depriving students of the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that college is meant to develop. - ChatGPT, 4o

# Course Materials

A list of course materials can be included here.

This template allows you to include a bibliography to reference.
Citations in brackets will display as the full cite.
Citations without brackets will display as a prose cite, so that you can reference it.
General details about citations in Quarto can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html).
The end bibliography is suppressed by default, so that you can include full cites in the full text.
